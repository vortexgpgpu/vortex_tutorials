# Vortex tutorials at [MICRO-56 (29th October 2023)](https://microarch.org/micro56/index.php)

Description:

[Vortex](http://vortex.cc.gatech.edu/) is an [open-source](https://github.com/vortexgpgpu/) hardware and software project to support GPGPU based on RISC-V ISA extensions. Currently, Vortex supports OpenCL/CUDA and it runs on FPGA. The Vortex platform is highly customizable and scalable with a complete open-source compiler, driver and runtime software stack to enable research in GPU architectures. In this tutorial, we will cover Vortex's hardware, software, applications, and provide hands-on exercises.

### Solutions
Solutions are available for [assignment 3](https://github.com/vortexgpgpu/vortex_tutorials/blob/main/Solutions/assignment3_solution.md) and [assignment 5](https://github.com/vortexgpgpu/vortex_tutorials/blob/main/Solutions/assignment5_solution.md).

## Mailing list
For tutorial info please join vortex-dev@lists.gatech.edu 

## VM Images
VM Access (recommended): please see the [VM README](VM_Imgs/VM_README.md) to get instructions for downloading and running the Vortex tools using Vagrant and VirtualBox.

## Remote Access
If you are not able to download and use the VM, the alternative is to use the Open OnDemand terminal interface hosted by the [CRNCH Rogues Gallery](https://crnch.gatech.edu/). Instructions coming soon.

## System Set Up Instructions
If you would like to set up Vortex on your own system instead of using a VM or remote access, instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/vortexgpgpu/vortex/blob/master/README.md) and pre-built toolchain details [here](https://github.com/vortexgpgpu/vortex-toolchain-prebuilt); they are for Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) systems only.

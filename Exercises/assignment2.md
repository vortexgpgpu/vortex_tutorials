# Assignment #2: Warp Efficiency Performance Counter (RTL)

In this assignment, you will add two new machine performance monitoring (MPM) counters to the GPU hardware to calculate the GPU **Warp Efficiency** after a kernel execution. These two counters, `total_issued_warps` and `total_active_threads`, will allow you to compute warp efficiency by dividing the number of active threads by the number of times a warp was issued for execution in the GPU pipeline.

The Warp Efficiency can be computed as:

```math
\text{Warp Efficiency} = \frac{\text{total\_active\_threads}}{\text{total\_issued\_warps} \times \text{warp\_size}} \times 100
```

Vortex already supports a few performance counters, and you can find the list in the file [/vortex/hw/rtl/VX_types.vh](https://github.com/vortexgpgpu/vortex/blob/master/hw/rtl/VX_types.vh). You will be adding two new counters for `total_issued_warps` and `total_active_threads`.

### Step 1: Reserve CSR Addresses for the New Counters

Start by reserving addresses in the CSR for the new counters. In `VX_types.vh`, under the "Machine Performance-monitoring memory counters (class 3)" section, add the following lines:

```verilog
`define VX_CSR_MPM_TOTAL_ISSUED_WARPS     12'hB03
`define VX_CSR_MPM_TOTAL_ISSUED_WARPS_H   12'hB83
`define VX_CSR_MPM_TOTAL_ACTIVE_THREADS   12'hB04
`define VX_CSR_MPM_TOTAL_ACTIVE_THREADS_H 12'hB84
```

You will also need to add the definition next to the other class definitions near the top:

```verilog
`define VX_DCR_MPM_CLASS_3              3

`define PERF_CTR_BITS                   44

```

### Step 2: Register the Counters CSRs

Next, you need to add logic to expose these counters in the CSR. In [VX_csr_data.sv](https://github.com/vortexgpgpu/vortex/blob/master/hw/rtl/core/VX_csr_data.sv#L276), add the new case for the new class of performance counters, along with the logic to read and expose them:

```verilog
`VX_DCR_MPM_CLASS_3: begin
    case (read_addr)
    // Add your custom counters here for Class 3:
    `CSR_READ_64(`VX_CSR_MPM_TOTAL_ISSUED_WARPS, read_data_ro_w, pipeline_perf.sched.total_issued_warps);
    `CSR_READ_64(`VX_CSR_MPM_TOTAL_ACTIVE_THREADS, read_data_ro_w, pipeline_perf.sched.total_active_threads);
    default:;
    endcase
end
```

### Step 3: Update the Performance Interface in VX_gpu_pkg.sv

Modify the performance structure `sched_perf_t` in [VX_gpu_pkg.sv](https://github.com/vortexgpgpu/vortex/blob/master/hw/rtl/VX_gpu_pkg.sv) to include the new counters:

```verilog
typedef struct packed {
  /***/
  logic [`PERF_CTR_BITS-1:0] total_issued_warps;
  logic [`PERF_CTR_BITS-1:0] total_active_threads;
} sched_perf_t;
```

### Step 4: Implement Logic for issue_warps and total_active_threads

You will now implement the logic for tracking `total_issued_warps` and `total_active_threads` in the `VX_schedule.sv` file.

In `VX_schedule.sv`, add the following registers under the bottom `ifdef PERF_ENABLE`:

```verilog
reg [`PERF_CTR_BITS-1:0] perf_total_issued_warps;
reg [`PERF_CTR_BITS-1:0] perf_total_active_threads;
```

In the `always @(posedge clk)` block (inside the same `ifdef PERF_ENABLE`), first add the logic to reset our counter when reset signal is asserted:

```verilog
perf_total_issued_warps <= 0;
perf_total_active_threads <= 0;
```

Also add the logic to increment these counters when a warp is issued (`schedule_if_fire`):

```verilog
if (schedule_if_fire) begin
  perf_total_issued_warps <= perf_total_issued_warps + 1;
  perf_total_active_threads <= perf_total_active_threads + $countones(schedule_if.data.tmask);
end
```

Assign these values to the performance interface after the `always @(posedge clk)` block:

```verilog
assign sched_perf.total_issued_warps = perf_total_issued_warps;
assign sched_perf.total_active_threads = perf_total_active_threads;
```

### Step 5: Expose the Counters in the Runtime

In the `vx_dump_perf` function in [`vortex/runtime/stub/vx_utils.cpp`](https://github.com/vortexgpgpu/vortex/blob/master/runtime/stub/vx_utils.cpp#L216), retrieve the values for `total_issued_warps` and `total_active_threads` and use them to calculate warp efficiency.

In `vx_utils.cpp`, add the following code to fetch the values from the CSR and calculate warp efficiency:

At the end of the other counter declarations in `vx_dump_perf`, add:
```cpp
// PERF: CLASS_3
uint64_t total_issued_warps = 0;
uint64_t total_active_threads = 0;
```

Then, add a new case for VX_DCR_MPM_CLASS_3 to calculate and print per-core Warp Efficiency in [`vortex/runtime/stub/vx_utils.cpp`](https://github.com/vortexgpgpu/vortex/blob/master/runtime/stub/vx_utils.cpp#L550):
```cpp
case VX_DCR_MPM_CLASS_3:
{
  uint64_t threads_per_warp;
  CHECK_ERR(vx_dev_caps(hdevice, VX_CAPS_NUM_THREADS, &threads_per_warp), {
    return err;
  });
  // Retrieve total_issued_warps and total_active_threads for each core

  // Query total_issued_warps for the core
  uint64_t total_issued_warps_per_core;
  CHECK_ERR(vx_mpm_query(hdevice, VX_CSR_MPM_TOTAL_ISSUED_WARPS, core_id, &total_issued_warps_per_core), {
    return err;
  });

  // Query total_active_threads for the core
  uint64_t total_active_threads_per_core;
  CHECK_ERR(vx_mpm_query(hdevice, VX_CSR_MPM_TOTAL_ACTIVE_THREADS, core_id, &total_active_threads_per_core), {
    return err;
  });

  // Print total_issued_warps and total_active_threads
  if (num_cores > 1) {
    // Calculate and print warp efficiency
    int warp_efficiency = calcAvgPercent(total_active_threads_per_core, total_issued_warps_per_core * threads_per_warp);
    fprintf(stream, "PERF: core%d: Warp Efficiency=%d%%\n", core_id, warp_efficiency);
  }

  // Accumulate totals for all cores
  total_issued_warps += total_issued_warps_per_core;
  total_active_threads += total_active_threads_per_core;
}
break;
```

and add the new case to calculate and print the total average Warp Efficiency of the GPU in [`vortex/runtime/stub/vx_utils.cpp`](https://github.com/vortexgpgpu/vortex/blob/master/runtime/stub/vx_utils.cpp#L630):
```cpp
case VX_DCR_MPM_CLASS_3: {
  uint64_t threads_per_warp;
  CHECK_ERR(vx_dev_caps(hdevice, VX_CAPS_NUM_THREADS, &threads_per_warp), {
    return err;
  });
  // Calculate and print warp efficiency
  int warp_efficiency = calcAvgPercent(total_active_threads, total_issued_warps * threads_per_warp);
  fprintf(stream, "PERF: Warp Efficiency=%d%%\n", warp_efficiency);
}
```

In this code, `vx_mpm_query` retrieves the counters from the hardware, and then warp efficiency is calculated by dividing `total_active_threads` by the product of `total_issued_warps` and `threads_per_warp`. The results are printed to the output stream for performance analysis.

### Step 6: Testing

To test your changes, you can run the software demo using the `--perf=3` command line argument. This will display your new `total_issued_warps` and `total_active_threads` counters. Be sure to run `../configure` after making changes to the vortex source in order for the changes to be reflected in the `build` directory.
And then run `make`

```bash
./ci/blackbox.sh --cores=4 --app=demo --driver=rtlsim --perf=3
```

You can run the demo application with a different input size to observe how the Warp Efficiency changes under various workloads:

```bash
./ci/blackbox.sh --cores=4 --app=demo --perf=3 --driver=rtlsim --args="-n16"
./ci/blackbox.sh --cores=4 --app=demo --perf=3 --driver=rtlsim --args="-n32"
./ci/blackbox.sh --cores=4 --app=demo --perf=3 --driver=rtlsim --args="-n64"
./ci/blackbox.sh --cores=4 --app=demo --perf=3 --driver=rtlsim --args="-n128"
```
